[![style: very good analysis][very_good_analysis_badge]][very_good_analysis_link]
[![License: MIT][license_badge]][license_link]

A mobile application to help connect pets with their forever homes. Built with Flutter.
Generated by the [Very Good CLI][very_good_cli_link] 🤖

## Features 🐾

- Browse available pets for adoption

## Getting Started 🚀

### Environment Setup

This project requires a Petfinder API key to function. You'll need to create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```sh
PETFINDER_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
PETFINDER_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here
```

To obtain these credentials:

1. Create a [Petfinder account](https://www.petfinder.com/user/register/)
2. Visit [Petfinder Developers](https://www.petfinder.com/developers/) to request an API key
3. Once approved, you'll receive a Client ID (API Key) and Client Secret

These credentials are used to authenticate with the Petfinder API using OAuth. The app will automatically handle token management for you.

### Running the App

This project contains 3 flavors:

**IMPORTANT: The app doesn't include any flavor specific configuration yet.**

- development
- staging
- production

To run the desired flavor either use the launch configuration in VSCode/Android Studio or use the following commands:

```sh
# Development
$ flutter run --flavor development --target lib/main_development.dart

# Staging
$ flutter run --flavor staging --target lib/main_staging.dart

# Production
$ flutter run --flavor production --target lib/main_production.dart
```

_\*Pet Finder works on iOS, and Android._

---

## Running Tests 🧪

To run all unit and widget tests use the following command:

```sh
$ flutter test --coverage --test-randomize-ordering-seed random
```

To view the generated coverage report you can use [lcov](https://github.com/linux-test-project/lcov).

```sh
# Generate Coverage Report
$ genhtml coverage/lcov.info -o coverage/

# Open Coverage Report
$ open coverage/index.html
```

## Working with Translations 🌐

This project relies on [flutter_localizations][flutter_localizations_link] and follows the [official internationalization guide for Flutter][internationalization_link].

**IMPORTANT: The app doesn't include translations yet but is ready to implement them.**

### Adding Strings

1. To add a new localizable string, open the `app_en.arb` file at `lib/l10n/arb/app_en.arb`.

```arb
{
    "@@locale": "en",
    "appTitle": "Pet Finder",
    "@appTitle": {
        "description": "The application title"
    },
    "findYourPet": "Find Your Perfect Pet",
    "@findYourPet": {
        "description": "Main header text on home screen"
    }
}
```

2. Then add a new key/value and description

```arb
{
    "@@locale": "en",
    "counterAppBarTitle": "Counter",
    "@counterAppBarTitle": {
        "description": "Text shown in the AppBar of the Counter Page"
    },
    "helloWorld": "Hello World",
    "@helloWorld": {
        "description": "Hello World Text"
    }
}
```

3. Use the new string

```dart
import 'package:pet_finder/l10n/l10n.dart';

@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  final l10n = context.l10n;
  return Text(l10n.helloWorld);
}
```

### Adding Supported Locales

Update the `CFBundleLocalizations` array in the `Info.plist` at `ios/Runner/Info.plist` to include the new locale.

```xml
    ...

    <key>CFBundleLocalizations</key>
	<array>
		<string>en</string>
		<string>es</string>
	</array>

    ...
```

### Adding Translations

1. For each supported locale, add a new ARB file in `lib/l10n/arb`.

```
├── l10n
│   ├── arb
│   │   ├── app_en.arb
│   │   └── app_es.arb
```

2. Add the translated strings to each `.arb` file:

`app_en.arb`

```arb
{
    "@@locale": "en",
    "counterAppBarTitle": "Counter",
    "@counterAppBarTitle": {
        "description": "Text shown in the AppBar of the Counter Page"
    }
}
```

`app_es.arb`

```arb
{
    "@@locale": "es",
    "counterAppBarTitle": "Contador",
    "@counterAppBarTitle": {
        "description": "Texto mostrado en la AppBar de la página del contador"
    }
}
```

### Generating Translations

To use the latest translations changes, you will need to generate them:

1. Generate localizations for the current project:

```sh
flutter gen-l10n --arb-dir="lib/l10n/arb"
```

Alternatively, run `flutter run` and code generation will take place automatically.

## Architecture 🏗️

This project follows a layered architecture with feature-oriented presentation:

```
├── lib/                         # Presentation Layer
│   ├── app/
│   │   ├── view/
│   │   │   ├── app.dart
│   │   └── cubit/
│   ├── animal_details/
│   │   ├── view/
│   │   │   └── widgets/
│   │   │   └── ...
│   │   └── cubit/
│   └── l10n/
├── packages/
    ├── animals_repository/      # Domain Layer
    └── petfinder_api_client/    # Data Layer

```

### Layered Architecture

The codebase is organized into three distinct layers:

1. **Domain Layer**

   - Defines core business entities
   - Bridge between the Data and Presentation Layers

2. **Data Layer**

   - Implements the PetFinder API client
   - Handles API requests and responses
   - Manages data models and their mapping

3. **Presentation Layer** (`lib/`)
   - Organized by features: app, home, and animal_details
   - Uses BLoC pattern for state management
   - Each feature contains its views and business logic
   - Depends on the domain layer for data access

### Feature Organization

The presentation layer contains three main features:

- **App**: Application setup and configuration
- **Home**: Main screen with pet listings
- **Animal Details**: Detailed view of individual pets

Each feature follows a similar structure with:

- Views (pages and widgets)
- BLoC for state management
- Communication with the domain layer through the animals repository

### Data Flow

```
UI → BLoC → Domain Layer (in this case only the Animals Repository) → Data Layer (PetFinder API Client) → PetFinder API
```

This architecture ensures:

- Clear separation of concerns
- Independent layers that can be tested in isolation
- Feature-based organization for better maintainability
- Scalable and modular codebase
